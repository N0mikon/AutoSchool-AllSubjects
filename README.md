# AutoSchool (All Subjects Fork)

A fully enhanced userscript for [GooBoo](https://tendsty.itch.io/gooboo) that automates answers for **Math, Literature, Art, and History** school challenges.

This fork of the original [AutoSchool](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/lucidobservor/AutoSchool) by *lucidobservor* includes major rewrites, added subject support, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

## ✨ Features

- 🧮 **Math**: Solves using Vue's internal solution property (safe with BigInt fallback)
- 📖 **Literature**: One-pass logic with first-question delay fix to avoid click bugs
- 🎨 **Art**: Matches blended color cells to correct RGB target
- 🏛️ **History**: Memorizes color–year pairs and auto-answers them in quiz phase
- 🔘 Toggle button injected automatically after game UI loads

## 📦 Install

Install directly via Tampermonkey:
